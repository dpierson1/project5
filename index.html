                                <p>Shameless offers a very refreshing story from Hollywood that captivates the audience without appealing to more archaic rhetoric such as wealth or sex. It starts off slowly with a dark and lackluster hue about the set. While adjusting to this depressing setting we meet the Gallagher family, a drug-ridden group void of rule from parents. A brave and resilient bunch however, the kids manage to raise themselves with the help of their older sister, Fiona. Our daring protagonist Phillip Gallagher lives a life that defies odds and instills hope and certainty unto the audience. A poor man, he uses his intelligence and cunningness to excel in a place that condemns academic success and the rich through ignorance.</p>
                                <p>A longer review would allow for more in-depth criticism but as I am to keep it short, I leave with this: Overall, Shameless is a fantastic show for anybody regardless of personal taste. It is a refreshing story that promotes self-guidance and an “only me” mentality to the viewer. An intuitive pairing this day and age.</p>

                            <p> Jack Bauer, played by Canadian actor Kiefer Sutherland, is a thrilling Counter Terrorist Agent who dodges bullets, jumps out of moving cars and will have your heart racing as the timer ticks to the next hour. 24, as hinted by the name, is a series of 24 one-hour long episodes that cover 24 consecutive hours of a mission. This simple method proves to be effective as the viewer can’t press the Play Next button fast enough they are so anxious! </p>
                            <p> The story is like that of other crime thrillers but is based around the Counter Terrorism Unit and as such, typically involves terrorism. The recurring themes of betrayal, heartbreak and heroism combine seamlessly with phenomenal acting with the right balance of mystery, romance and action to create one of the epic TV series of this millennium. One would have to be a traitor not to watch this unbelievable work of art.</p>

                            <p> Four Christmases is an instant classic. Vaguely following the plot to National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation, our dual-protagonists miss their vacation to Fiji and are forced to spend Christmas travelling between the houses of each parent, discovering about themselves and their families. Vince Vaughan is a hilarious and successful millennial who lives with his partner of equal stature who is portrayed by Reese Witherspoon. The two add a refreshing modern young twist to an old tale as both suffer from marital gamophobia. Through interactions with their families however, they discover the true meaning of love and ultimately overcome their fears, deciding to have children and settle into the confines of monogamy. </p>
                            <p>Overall Four Christmases is a light romantic comedy perfect for couples to watch around the holidays. The familiar faces and simple plot also make it a great movie for the whole family to watch, though mom and dad may want to censor some material.</p>

                             <p> The hockey movie of all hockey movies. Goon is a Canadian classic that displays the rough side of hockey in a hilarious story that will be watched for generations. Doug Glatt is a hometown Canadian boy with an IQ level around three standard deviations below the mean. He is a soft and kind boy who wouldn’t hurt a fly. But upon provocation, Glatt reveals the strongest and most effective punch anyone has ever seen. Though many want him to fight in bars, his best friend knows where his talents can really be utilized: the rink. The pair head down to the local junior practice and ask for a tryout. A shaking Glatt steps on the ice ankles bent, knees touching and sporting a Jofa helmet. A true rookie. He is all but laughed off until the team sees him fight. He is instantly signed despite his skating ability and maturely picks the number 69. An epic slew of hockey fights, love, and hilarity then highjack the remainder of the film. To know the end, you’ll have to go watch this epic classic!</p>

                        <p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9RHqdZDCF0"> "42" Trailer</a> </p>
                        <p> The film 42 tells a heroic tale of the late Jackie Robinson, the first African American baseball player. In 1947 Robinson signed a contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Throughout the film, Robinson goes through many instances where most people at that point in time would give up. Jackie persevered through all the racial slurs, threats and even physical abuse from other players on the field. A pivotal moment in the movie is when Robinson’s team mate Pee Wee Reese puts his arm around Robinson in front of an adjugated Cincinnati crowd. This powerful film honors Jackie Robinson, one of the most celebrated professional baseball players ever. Not only did he break racial barriers on the diamond, Jackie also had a positive impact on society. This film is a must watch for sports lovers, fans of historical period dramas, or people that just love a feel-good story!   </p>
